# The Glint Chronicles:

## Duskfall

# I

There are three things all young orphans carry with them on the gloomy, cobbled streets of Venaratie. There was no memo sent out and it wasn’t any kind of uniform, yet if you approached any of the young wayward ‘street rats’ they would most certainly possess all three.

A cloak, a trinket and an excuse.

Cloaks provide shelter against the elements and allow one to conceal themselves when needed. Mouse’s was an old, patchwork blanket he’d found outside an inn one day. It was able to fully cover his small, scrawny frame and keep him warm on cold, rainy nights like tonight.

Next, the trinket. Street rats, contrary to popular belief, didn’t just materialise out of thin air. They were children who were abandoned. Alone. Each one cast aside at some stage of their sorrowful lives. But as children do, they held onto the what-ifs and maybes of what could have been. The meager item they were left with - a button, a bracelet, a stuffed toy - becomes their most prized possession, untradeable for any amount of food or money. Well… almost any amount of money.

Mouse’s was a small silver hairpin, with a clear crystal embedded as the centerpiece. He’d had it as long as he can remember and used it to tuck the wild, tawny hair out of his eyes. He’d considered selling it once or twice - it would certainly fetch a good price - but a faint memory of laughter and soft hands had stopped him each time.

Finally, an excuse. A street rat without an excuse is a dead street rat. Why are you here? What are you doing? Where are you going? Answered incorrectly, or even worse - honestly, would not end well for you. They all learnt this lesson very early on.

Mouse’s current excuse for being nestled into a high, rooftop window of the Anchor’s Rest was that he was using it as shelter from the howling winds. The real reason, of course, was to get a glimpse of her…

Joy.

Having once heard of something called the ‘sun’ when he was younger, Mouse often imagined what a ‘beam of warm light’ could possibly look like. Looking at Joy, and the way her face lit up when she laughed, that had to be pretty close. Through the crowds and bustle of the tavern, she just seemed to glow. Not literally of course. The only people literally glowing were the Lanterns when they did their magic. No. Joy glowed in a different way entirely.

Entranced, Mouse watched her glide through the rabble that had filled up the tavern this evening, her golden hair flowing behind her. Not a single drop of precious alcohol was spilt as she twirled and dipped and dodged through the ever-shifting, ever-burping mess of bodies stumbling around.

Imagine a tiny tin of sardines where each sardine complained about its day, demanded booze and, somehow, smelt even worse than your average stuffed-in-a-tin sardine - that was the nicer looking patrons of the riverside tavern. Not that the building itself was much better. It looked like a shipwreck in progress and had the atmosphere to match. There seemed to have been an attempt to nicen up the rotting tables with some candles, but in reality they were likely to be used as weapons later on in the evening when the inevitable brawl began.

For a second, Mouse wondered who would possibly want to go into such a place to try and spend the evening, before promptly remembering that in fact, he did.

Mouse and his kind weren’t allowed in very many places and this was no exception. He had tried disguises, bribery, even just politely asking, but to many people the street rats are lying, dirty thieves who would take whatever they could, whenever they could. They were right of course, but Mouse really wanted to go into the tavern. Soon he would find a way in, one day, maybe even today…

Mouse rubbed his grubby sleeve against the glass he’d fogged up with his breath, and peered down through the rafters, looking for where Joy had gone.

She wasn’t there.

Mouse rubbed his sleeve even more vigorously to clear his view, but also started breathing heavier, causing more fog, which caused more rubbing, which of course was blocking his view, which caused heavier breathing.

Had someone kidnapped her? Had she fallen and been trampled by a drunken oaf? Had she found the love of her life and run away? Had she - oh wait, there she was. She had just popped behind the bar to fill up some extra drinks. Then off she went again, through the crowd to a table of dock-workers in the corner. Despite their best efforts to conceal themselves in the shadows, their chiseled faces were unfortunately revealed by the candlelight, each more ugly than the last.

Joy placed the drinks on the table, or she would have, if they hadn’t been snatched by the desperate hands of the workers. Each one clinging onto their new most valuable possession. This was it. The reason Mouse had crammed himself into a narrow, wet window ledge. He couldn’t hear the words from his perch, but he saw Joy’s mouth move and eyes crease. A joke perhaps, maybe a sweet anecdote. Cracks started appearing amongst the weathered gargoyles sat around the table. The walls they had barricaded themselves behind weren’t prepared for this. Daily hardships? Check. Nobody to trust? Check. The laughter of a pretty girl? Mouse couldn’t think of anyone who’s defences could withstand that.

The frowns turned to smiles and the smiles turned to laughter. Suddenly, as if by magic, an entirely different group of people sat around the table. Not the divine magic of the Lanterns or, thankfully, the illegal magic of wizards, but the pure, simple, magic of Joy. They continued to laugh and swap stories, revelling in each other's company.

Realising he was holding his breath, Mouse exhaled and found his reflection grinning back at him through the misted glass. She had that effect. The grinning didn’t last long though. One of the workers had reached out in an attempt to drag Joy towards him. She managed to evade his grasp and disappear back into the crowd, smiling the whole time, but Mouse could see the difference in her eyes. The fear. Did those workers not know how lucky they were? What makes them think they are entitled to her? Why did she have to waste her time with that sorry lot?

A commotion in the centre of the tavern tore Mouse’s glare away from his new enemies. It seemed a walrus had clambered out of the Rau and flopped its way on top of one of the tables. Rubbing his eyes instead of the glass this time, Mouse realised that it was not a walrus, but a rather walrus-looking, pot-bellied, drunkard who had decided that what everyone really wanted right now was a rousing song.

Every now and then, travelling performers setup in the upper levels of the city and entertain passers-by with tales of the Radiants and enchanting music. Mouse had once seen such a performance from a distant rooftop and even from afar, felt the incredible talents and showmanship on display.

If you ignored the uncoordinated swaying, blocked out the tone-deaf singing and squinted really, really hard then maybe you could pretend that one of those shows was now taking place in the Anchor’s Rest. Unfortunately for the self-appointed bard, that was far too many steps for the audience to carry out. It was a lot easier for them to grab a nearby piece of ammunition and throw it at the man.

The first tomato caught Walrus in the shoulder, followed quickly by a bread roll to the face. The barrage only grew in intensity until the man was coated in enough food to be served up as a salad himself. Shockingly, some people had managed to somehow miss the giant target and hit those on the other side of the table. A rational person may realise the innocent mistake and laugh it off. As you have surely gathered by now though, these are not rational people and that is not what happened.

Chaos erupted. Food flying. Fists flying. A chair flying. Then a person flying. Crash. Straight out the window. Splash. Straight into the river. Several candles had their destinies fulfilled, brandished as makeshift clubs to further the carnage. One pair of particularly agile brawlers seemed to have found themselves in an elaborate sword-fight, one wielding a fire poker, the other a ladle. Mouse watched them fight across a tabletop, parrying and evading, before both being taken out by a large sack of apples that was soaring across the battlefield.

Mouse felt his heart begin to race. Not because of the fighting, but because of the opportunity it presented. This was the second reason he was here. Wait for a brawl and then no one would notice him slip in. Right? He could climb down, squeeze through the door and find Joy. From there, they would sneak into the kitchen and find a hiding spot. A hiding spot with some of those bread rolls would be nice. They could talk and laugh about Walrus’s performance. Maybe he could even learn her real name.

Crack

The old oak door was the next victim. The impact brought Mouse back to reality. Getting to the entrance was easy; navigating that arena wouldn’t be. Mouse found his hand rubbing his hairpin as he contemplated the plan, as it often did when he was thinking.

It was pretty dangerous down there. Was this fight more brutal than the last? Maybe he should try another time when it is a calmer chaotic fight?

He clenched his fist.

“No. Today is the day” he muttered, as if saying it aloud would make it true. “It’ll be easy. Just through the door, past the drunks, find Joy, find a hidey-hole, talk to Joy”

"Funny, I swear I heard that one yesterday. Or was it last week?"

Mouse jumped up, banging his head against the beam above him. He peered out into the darkness, frantically looking for the source of the voice.

“‘It’s just a tavern brawl’, ‘she’ll want to talk’, ‘today is the day’” the voice continued in a mocking, whimsical tone.

Ignoring the fatal drop below, Mouse leapt from his ledge to the nearby rooftop. The voice was coming from around this direction… Yep. Thought so. There, lounging against a stack of crates, was the lanky figure of Twig.

Fashion wasn’t something Mouse cared about. It wasn’t something anyone he knew cared about. Except for Twig, who had once traded his last piece of bread for a top hat with only two holes in it.

Today, in addition to the usual mottled red cloak, Twig was wearing said top hat, an oversized waistcoat, striped trousers and a pair of mismatched boots. He flipped a broken pocket watch into his hands before carrying on,

“You don’t really think you’ll go in, do ya?’

“I’ve got a good feeling about today,” Mouse countered, “I’m gonna do it!”

“You said that one last week and didn’t even make it to the door”
“Yeah.. well.. today’s different..” Mouse said, hoping the words captured some of the confidence he was rapidly losing sight of.

“Look, M, can we not do this today?” Twig stood up, fastening the few buttons that still clung to his waistcoat. “Word on the street is that Spud has some leftovers he’s gonna be throwing out. If we’re quick we can get there before the bells ring.”

For most people, the slippery edge with nothing but certain death awaiting one wrong step wouldn’t be their first choice of thinking spots, yet Mouse paced back and forth taking in the news. If Spud had some leftovers, then he’d have guaranteed food for the rest of the week. It’d be easier talking to Joy with a full stomach, right?

“Well I’m goin’’, Twig called out, ‘stay here and enjoy the view but I ain’t gettin’ any extra for you”. He stood up onto his crate and lept, grabbing onto an overhanging ledge.

Joy could wait. He could find another job. But food? Food couldn’t wait. Mouse watched Twig climbing away and took one last glance at the tavern.

He would have gone in. He would have.

# Chapter 2

Imagine a wooden shack. Small. Rickety. The kind of place, with enough time, even you could build out in a forest somewhere. Now add a stone house next to it. Don’t use anything fancy like cement. Just stack some stones on top of each other and call it a house. Add a chimney. Add a few more shacks, both next to and on top of your growing home. Now imagine a group of people all doing the same thing with buildings all overlapping and piling on top of one another. If one dodgy tavern is over here and an even dodgier market stall is over there, let's add a couple bridges to help get around. Do all that for a couple hundred years and you’d start to get something that resembles The Lanes.

Ordinarily, such a neighbourhood may sprawl outwardly, requiring less stacking and more spreading. However, as the city of Veneratie was built above a giant ravine, the situation called for verticality. Whilst the mid level of the city sits comfortably across the top of the ravine, supported by ancient stone pillars and sturdy bridges, the Lanes grow out from beneath it like a creaking fungal growth spreading down the sides of the rocky walls. It tumbles all the way down to the river Rau which snakes along the bottom - The Depths, as it is creatively called by those unfortunate enough to call it home.

As Mouse hauled himself onto the roof of a particularly small and untrustworthy shack, he looked back down at the Anchor’s Rest. Having clambered up several stories, the lights were barely visible through the mist. The sounds of fighting had long since been drowned out by the oppressive silence that held the Lanes hostage. Despite the thousands crowded into the cramped space, Mouse could scarcely count the times he had heard any proof of that. Noise meant attention. And attention, in the Lanes, meant trouble.
With a small run up, Mouse leapt from the wooden roof, aiming for a pipe that was running down the side of a cobbled tower. As his hands grabbed onto the metal hold, his feet slipped against growing moss, leaving him dangling above the chasm below.

Why hadn’t he checked for moss? Just last week, Leaf had fallen and broken his wrist after landing on a patch of the stuff. Mouse tried to bring his feet back up but once again, was unable to find any grip.

Maybe there’s a ledge or window? He scanned the area, desperately trying to ignore his weakening grip. The top of this stupid tower wasn’t even that far away, but he knew he couldn’t reach it.

Ignoring the drop below, Mouse figured he had several problems. Chief among them: gravity, which was both relentless and very unhelpful. The rain wasn’t helping either.

Damn.

“Okay,” he muttered to himself. “Bad. But not the worst.” Then his fingers slipped an inch. “Ok, maybe the worst”

Mouse looked down - something he generally tried to avoid - and was met with the darkness below. The kind of darkness that suggested a very final, and very permanent end if you found yourself falling into it. With a swing he could maybe hit that building over there, but there was no guarantee he’d even survive that.

Mouse closed his eyes. He had never even found out her name.

‘What the hell have you got your eyes closed for!’

Mouse reopened his eyes to find his view of certain death blocked by a pale hand.

Looking up, he saw a familiar top hat poking over the edge of the tower.

‘Are you gonna grab my hand or what?’ asked Twig, in a way that Mouse knew wasn’t really a question. He grasped onto the lifeline and felt himself hauled up on top of the tower. He must have been lighter than Twig was expecting as he crashed into his rescuer with enough speed to knock them both down onto the cold slabs.

‘Did ya not check for moss?’ Twig managed to utter in between panting breaths.

‘Clearly I didn’t check for any damned moss’ Mouse managed to reply, also struggling to find his words, ‘when did this tower even appear?’

‘I dunno, was here last week when I was runnin’ from those Lanterns. Didn’t use it cus I spotted the moss from way back over there, plus the whole thing looks a bit wobbly’

‘Nah, it definitely wasn’t here yesterday’ Mouse knew that for certain. There had actually been a lovely staircase in this spot that he’d used to get all the way up to the Nest.

‘Who cares when it showed up, you know shit moves around’ sighed Twig, springing up onto his feet.

Mouse joined him, standing up and brushing the damp mud off of his tattered trousers. ‘Yeah you’re right, I guess this is just one I need to watch out for’

It was true. Here, in the Lanes, it seemed like every day some new structure emerged, cramming itself onto its neighbours. Maybe people were building them or maybe they were simply popping into existence. Mouse only knew that you could find all manner of buildings if you went looking, seemingly constructed with whatever random materials had happened to be laying nearby.

A fellow street rat, Pebble, had once claimed to find a place made entirely from bones. Mouse had tried to find it with her but Pebble had been unable to relocate the morbid site. Not that she could be blamed for that. It was just as easy to lose buildings as find them. Some people, including Mouse, believed they moved around and the Lanes were a constantly shifting labyrinth. Others just assumed they’d got lost in the numerous, snake-like passages and dark, twisting tunnels that ran through the place.

Mouse sighed, as interesting as the tower was, he knew what was coming next. He may as well start it.

‘Well whatever. I didn’t check for moss and now I owe you. What do you want?’

Twig raised his hands, feigning an innocence that neither of them bought for a second ‘nah I don’t want anything. Honest. Just saw a friend in need and all that’

Mouse raised his eyebrow. Twig was probably the closest thing he had to a friend here, but risking his own life for no reward was not a staple of his character.

‘Well.. I suppose now you mention it, and as we do happen to be headed to Spud’s... I wouldn’t mind myself a little extra grub if you happened to be offering it..’

There it was. Mouse didn’t hold it against him. He owed him and some extra leftovers seemed like a fair enough price. Still… he was hungry as well.

‘Yeah I can do that - if that's what you want to waste the favour on’ shrugged Mouse. Was that too obvious? The shrug was definitely overkill.

‘Whaddayamean waste?’ replied Twig, adjusting his top hat. ‘I save you, I get extra food. That seems fine to me’

Maybe he hadn’t seen through it after all? A little more might be enough.

“I’d hope my life is worth more than half a stale potato, Twig.” It wasn’t, but that's beside the point.

The cogs were whirring behind Twig’s eyes. If he could just make the suggestion himself, then Mouse may have a full meal yet.

‘Hmm, didn’t you say you was eyeing a gig in some tavern up by East Pillar - one where you’d get leftovers every day?’

Success. Mouse had dropped that little bit of information just in case of a situation like this.

‘Yeah I was speaking to a guy there who said he could sort me out for a week. Apparently there’s a heap of food each day’. Now to seal the deal. ‘Hey! Don’t think you can use your favour to get in on that, that's my food!’

Twig sidled up to Mouse with the careful precision of someone who both valued personal space and had very little of it to work with.

"Tell you what—forget Spud’s. Just give me a cut of your tavern haul.” He waved his arms towards the chasm below, “Y’know - since I did just stop you going splat”

Mouse scratched his chin, pretending to consider the offer. He had no intention of going to East Pillar. The guy he’d spoken to had later been fired for even suggesting a street rat could work there. Twig didn’t need to know that information just yet though.

He sighed dramatically, ‘Well, I suppose I could do that… for a friend’ he extended his hand which was met with the enthusiastic shaking of someone who had no idea they’d been fooled.

Beaming at his own genius, Twig looked up at where he thought he night sky might be

“Thank the Radiants!” he exclaimed, “Well, we should prolly get going. We’ll get nothin’ if we hang about here”

After a few more close calls involving a loose brick, a rotten plank and an unnecessarily angry homeowner, Mouse and Twig found themselves meandering down a tight alleyway. The alley was more of a suggestion than an actual path, a cramped walkway where every turn seemed to defy reality. The cobblestones were uneven, and the walls leaned inward like they were conspiring to slowly squeeze the life out of anyone trapped within.

Twig was now clutching his top hat in his hands after the low ceilings had beaten him into submission. Mouse looked at the back of his shaved head, trying to picture himself without the scruffy waves that made up his own hair. It was common enough. No hair to get in your eyes or for someone to pull on in a fight. But despite the offer of several would-be barbers, Mouse just couldn’t do it. His hair was part of him, like his green eyes or the scar on his left thigh. Would he get rid of the scar if he could? Maybe a tattoo could be cool? Of what? A mouse? A dog? Maybe a -

‘Are you sure it was this way?’ moaned Twig, ‘I could’ve sworn we shoulda turned right back there’

Whoops. The vision of his thigh covered with a knife-wielding, dog-riding mouse blinked out of existence. Ok - there was the green door with the brass handle. That should mean the oil lamp with the dent in it should be just round…here. Check.

‘You’re lost aren’t you’ Twig continued, ‘I knew it. We shoulda gone left by that bridge shouldn’t we? Or even up the ladder next to those - ’

‘Do you remember the last time we trusted your directions?’ Mouse snapped, ‘I’m not lost. It's definitely near here somewhere…’

They turned the corner, or rather, the corner turned them, and there it was. Spud’s stall was crammed into a gap that most people would’ve considered a mistake. It was wedged between two buildings that looked like they’d been constructed accidentally after a night of heavy drinking, with walls leaning in on each other as though gossiping about the idiot who decided to set up shop between them.

Then the lingering aroma of baked bread and pastries filled their nostrils. Mouse closed his eyes, breathing in the scents and allowing them to transport him to another life. One where the taste of fresh, warm bread was a memory, not fantasy. Where laughter was shared easily amongst friends and they could go and enjoy each other’s company in any tavern of their choosing.

He would be tall in this life. He would walk through the mid levels of the city wearing the finest green cloak with a shiny golden fastening. He should be carrying something important. A book? Yes, carrying a leatherbound book in one hand and a bag of freshly baked bread in the other. Twig would be there of course, relaxing nonchalantly on a street corner in expensive robes, maybe with some others they could call friends.

What would be an impressive job?. Maybe a doctor, smart and wealthy. Or maybe a mercenary, that would be cool, he’d have a sword and shield to fight off enemies.

A roar from his stomach brought Mouse crashing back to the cold shadow that concealed him. Forget swords and books and cloaks. He needed to focus. He’d have food soon enough, but patience was key. Show up too early and Spud would see you, beat you and kick you down the nearest ladder. That’s if he was in a good mood. Show up too late, and the food would be gone.

Tap tap tap. He glanced back and saw Twig’s silhouette pointing upwards. He followed the invisible line, trying to spot whatever needed spotting up amongst the rooftops. At first he didn't see anything, and looked back to Twig with a quizzical shrug. In a rather unhelpful manner, Twig simply shrugged back and carried on pointing in the same direction.

With a sigh, Mouse peered back up, slowly casting his gaze across the chaos. Lamp, pipe, washing line, hand, window, lamp. Wait… Hand? He checked again and there it was - a small pale hand clutching onto the roof’s edge.

Competition.

He knew they wouldn't have been the only ones to hear about the food, but he'd hoped they would be the first to arrive. So there was one up on the roof. Anywhere else? Another sweep turned up two more contenders. The first was down the other end of the alley, squeezed so far into an alcove he was in danger of becoming a permanent fixture. The other had crammed themselves into a crate right next to Spud’s stall. Risky. Mouse had only spotted her when she’d poked her head out like a very shy jack-in-the-box, checking if it was safe to pop out.

A crash from within the stall seized Mouse’s attention. A large hand had emerged from the dim light, gripping onto the surrounding woodwork. The air itself seemed to hold its breath as the stall groaned and shuddered, reluctantly giving birth to a giant, imposing figure.

Broad, unyielding and with a face that had earned him his name, Spud reached back into the stall and plucked a small, metal bucket from within. It was actually a regular sized bucket, but in Spud’s meaty hands it may as well have been a thimble.

He turned it over unceremoniously and, like the contents of a drunkard’s stomach, leftovers began to spill out onto the muddy path. Stale crusts, gristle and unidentifiable lumps spewed out until all that remained were the drips of what Mouse hoped was gravy.

Spud threw the bucket back into the stall with a clatter, before pulling a metal sheet down over the entrance. Then, step by step, he lumbered forward, the alley bending to his presence with no choice but to accommodate his hulking frame.

Slowly, but surely, the sound of footsteps began to weaken, quieter and quieter, until…finally…silence.

Where time had previously been moving at its usual, steady pace, it instead slowed down, as if to make sure it could get a good view of what was to come.

Had another passerby entered the alley at that moment, they could be forgiven for thinking it was just another empty passage. They wouldn’t be frozen by the tension permeating through every nook and cranny. They wouldn’t hold their breath in anticipation, waiting for the slightest movement. They certainly wouldn’t want anything to do with the slop that now formed an insipid puddle on the floor.

Mouse, on the other hand, was experiencing all of these things, all at once, and as was often the case, that meant dealing with none of them at all.

A blur of mismatched clothing and desperation interrupted his indecision as Twig rushed into the alley with hands outstretched. Mouse reached out, trying to halt Twig’s progress for the sake of caution but was met with the wild, hungry eyes of a stranger. He recoiled, watching the creature in Twig’s clothing race out of the shadows and no sooner than it did, the alley erupted.

The jack-in-the-box sprung out the crate, leaping onto her prize and scooping up everything that her little hands could find. Next into the fray was Alcove, who darted out as fast as his limp would let him. His eyes widened and he veered towards a carrot that had fallen near the edge of the mess. Unfortunately, Twig had had the same idea and the two boys collided, ending up in a wrestling match for the orange trophy. Then came the rooftop watcher, who had apparently decided the bodies below looked like a perfect cushion for his fall. With all the grace of a falling brick, he dropped down, crashing into the growing heap of flailing limbs.

Mouse edged closer to the frenzy. There would be a gap in the chaos he could exploit. A small opening to snatch something, anything, that could keep him going for a few more days. He watched as Alcove snatched a crust off Rooftop, who responded by biting down on the thief’s arm. They tumbled out of the bundle, leaving a Mouse shaped hole in their wake.
